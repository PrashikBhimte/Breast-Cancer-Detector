Project Title: Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression

Description: This project uses logistic regression to detect breast cancer from a dataset containing various attributes of breast tumors.

Files:

- breast_cancer.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- main.py: The Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- report.pdf: A PDF report detailing the project's methodology, results, and conclusions.
- README.md: This file.

Usage:

1. Install the required libraries by running pip install pandas scikit-learn.
2. Run the script using python main.py.
3. The script will train the model, evaluate its performance, and print the results.

Dataset:

- The dataset contains 683 instances with 11 attributes.
- The attributes include tumor size, shape, and other characteristics.
- The target variable is the diagnosis (malignant or benign).

Model:

- The model used is logistic regression.
- The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

Performance Metrics:

- Accuracy
- Standard deviation 

Results:

- Accuracy: 96.7%
- Standard deviation: 1.96 

Dependencies:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
